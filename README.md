# Real-time-object-detection-using-OpenCV
Designed a working model which can able to capture the real time objects in the frame captured by webcam and provide the information about location in terms of bounding box and accuracy of the captured objects within the frame.  
This model can be used as a plugin in robots and automated cars for detecting various real time objects.  
Technologies used in making this project - Python OpenCV
